# AMLS_21-22-_SN21213556

This repository was created to implement two algorithms: a binary classifier and a multi-class classifier for MRI brain tumour images. Four files compose the project:

* **Script.ipynb**: Contains all the algorithms implemented to solve both classification tasks.
* **.gitignore**: A file required to omit files from the GitHub source control project.
* **dataset**: A folder which contains all the neccesary data for this project. The "dataset" folder contains:
  * **label.csv**: A CSV file containing a first column with image filenames and a second column with labels for each image.
  * **label_data.csv**: A CSV file inherited from "label.csv" which contains also further colums with features extracted from each image (see report for full description).
  * **image**: A folder containing all 2000 images from the brain MRI tumour dataset available at "Sartaj Bhuvaji, Ankita Kadam, Prajakta Bhumkar, Sameer Dedge, and Swati Kanchan, “Brain Tumor
Classification (MRI).” Kaggle, 2020, doi: 10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/1183165"
